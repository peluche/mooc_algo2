Question 1
We are given as input a set of n requests (e.g., for the use of an auditorium), with a known start time si and finish time ti for each request i. Assume that all start and finish times are distinct. Two requests conflict if they overlap in time --- if one of them starts between the start and finish times of the other. Our goal is to select a maximum-size subset of the given requests that contains no conflicts. (For example, given three requests consuming the intervals [0,3], [2,5], and [4,7], we want to return the first and third requests.) We aim to design a greedy algorithm for this problem with the following form: At each iteration we select a new request i, including it in the solution-so-far and deleting from future consideration all requests that conflict with i. Which of the following greedy rules is guaranteed to always compute an optimal solution?
- At each iteration, pick the remaining request with the earliest start time.
- At each iteration, pick the remaining request with the earliest finish time.
- At each iteration, pick the remaining request with the fewest number of conflicts with other remaining requests (breaking ties arbitrarily).
- At each iteration, pick the remaining request which requires the least time (i.e., has the smallest value of tiâˆ’si) (breaking ties arbitrarily).

i want to compare case 2 and 3
